Flesh out the README with env setup and pnpm dev instructions (and add .env.example if desired)

# React + TypeScript + Vite

Boilerplate for React, Typescript, Vite, with React Router (declarative mode), with Convex for the backend and Clerk for auth and payments. Tailwind and Shadcn for styling.

1. Basic installation of React, Typescript, and Vite. [https://vite.dev/guide/]. Using pnpm to install the basic React and Vite setup, choosing Typescript.
2. Installed React Router Declarative mode (react-router-dom). [https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation]. Used `pnpm add react-router-dom` to install React Router Declarative mode. No SSR bs.
3. Installed Tailwind and Shadcn [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite].
4. Installed Convex [https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react].
5. Installed Clerk.
   a. First Clerk [https://clerk.com/docs/react/getting-started/quickstart].
   b. Combine it with Convex [https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/integrations/databases/convex].

# Things Missing

1. Error + analytics tracking

Add Sentry (or a simple console.error + Convex log setup) and analytics (PostHog, Plausible, or Umami).
→ You’ll thank yourself later when you start getting user sessions and weird edge cases.

2. Basic state management / query abstraction

If you’re building bigger apps, decide now how you’ll handle data fetching and caching:
• Either lean entirely on Convex’s React hooks,
• or wrap them in a simple store (Zustand, Jotai, etc.) to keep state clean.

3. Payments & Billing

Really depends on the business modal for the app.
